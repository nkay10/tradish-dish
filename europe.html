  <h3>Waltrop, Germany</h3>
  <p>Living in a foreign country far away from my family, has its ups and downs. As much I love travelling and exploring the world, there are always times when I miss home. And there is no better remedy for these moments than my Mama’s scrumptious lentil soup. It’s a simple dish, really. But there is something about it that fills my belly with love and makes me feel at ease.</p>

  <h4>Moscow, Russia</h4>
  <p>My favorite dish from the Russian cuisine is called "Herring under a fur coat". It looks as strange as it  sounds but it tastes delicious. It's strange purplish color comes from one of its components - beetroot. Basically it is a salad made with multiple layers of all the ingredients that Russians love in their cold salads - potatoes, carrots, eggs and mayonnaise. But the main ingredient which gives the salad its name is herring. We usually cook it in winter and typically for New Year's dinner.
  <blockquote>The funny story I have related with this dish happened a couple of years ago when I invited my  European friends for a Russian dinner at my place. Without a doubt "Herring under a fur coat" was one of the numerous dishes on the table. As we sat down and I started serving the dishes, I recommended to start with this cold salad. My friends replied that they would like to start with salty food first and keep dessert for later. You must have seen their shock when I explained to them that "Herring under a fur coat" is actually a cold salty salad and hardly can be called a dessert. No one could believe it until they actually tried it. It was the first dish that was over within a few minutes of us starting the dinner. In the end everyone chose to call it a "Fish cake" emphasizing its sweet-looking nature.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Although every Russian family has its own recipe and truly believes that their recipe is the best, my mother's variation of it has been repeatedly appreciated by our friends and relatives, and deserves to be shared.</blockquote></p>

  <h4>Hamburg, Germany</h4>
  <p>Tafelspitz - very traditional and delicious! My nan used to cook it for the family and guests. Especially when it is cold outside and you are sitting in the living room with everyone. It warms you up and it is a very healthy dish with all those vegetables and the dark meat. I would not cook it only for myself, but if you are a big group - I would call it a perfect dish.</p>
